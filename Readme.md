## About
This application is used by a restaurant to calculate the price of the orders of its clients.
It works (mostly) and has lots of comments which is good, right ?

But there is no tests and no obvious way to prove that the app is working as expected

## What's my job ?

You need to introduce tests to ensure that the app works in a coherent way, fix the eventual bugs and refactor it in order to leave a cleaner code base !
